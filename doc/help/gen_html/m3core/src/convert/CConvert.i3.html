<P> low-level C routines for numeric conversions.
<P>
   Index: conversion;  numbers;  ASCII 

<P><PRE>INTERFACE <interface><A HREF="CConvert.m3.html">CConvert</A></interface>;

FROM <A HREF="../C/Common/Ctypes.i3.html">Ctypes</A> IMPORT double, int, int_star, char_star, char_star_star;

&lt;* EXTERNAL m3_strtod *&gt;
PROCEDURE strtod (nptr: ADDRESS; VAR eptr: ADDRESS): LONGREAL;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Returns a nearest machine number to the input decimal string
   (or sets errno to ERANGE).  With IEEE arithmetic, ties are broken
   by the IEEE round-even rule.  Otherwise ties are broken by biased
   rounding (add half and chop).  </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

&lt;* EXTERNAL m3_dtoa*&gt;
PROCEDURE dtoa (d: double;  mode: int;  ndigits: int;  decpt: int_star;
                sign: int_star;  rve: char_star_star): char_star;
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE><EM> Converts a C double to an ASCII string. </EM></BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
</PRE> Arguments ndigits, decpt, sign are similar to those
   of ecvt and fcvt; trailing zeros are suppressed from
   the returned string.  If not null, *rve is set to point
   to the end of the return value.  If d is +-Infinity or NaN,
   then *decpt is set to 9999.
<P>
   mode:
     0 ==&gt; shortest string that yields d when read in
           and rounded to nearest.
     1 ==&gt; like 0, but with Steele &amp; White stopping rule;
           e.g. with IEEE P754 arithmetic , mode 0 gives
           1e23 whereas mode 1 gives 9.999999999999999e22.
     2 ==&gt; ndigits significant digits.  This gives a return
           value similar to that of ecvt, except that
           trailing zeros are suppressed.
     3 ==&gt; through ndigits past the decimal point.  This
           gives a return value similar to that from fcvt,
           except that trailing zeros are suppressed.
     4-9 should give the same return values as 2-3, i.e.,
           4 &lt;= mode &lt;= 9 ==&gt; same return as mode
           2 + (mode &amp; 1).  These modes are mainly for
           debugging; often they run slower but sometimes
           faster than modes 2-3.
     4,5,8,9 ==&gt; left-to-right digit generation.
     6-9 ==&gt; don't try fast floating-point estimate
           (if applicable).
<P>
     Values of mode other than 0-9 are treated as mode 0.
<P>
     Sufficient space is allocated to the return value
     to hold the suppressed trailing zeros.
