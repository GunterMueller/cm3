building older versions

1) Best to lump sysutils in with m3core/libm3.
If you are building versions prior to me fixing libm3
that had a dependency on the precise list of platforms.

2)
"../src/Main.m3", line 10: unable to find interface (M3Config)
1 error encountered
new exporters -> recompiling Utils.i3
compilation failed => not building program "cm3"
Fatal Error: package build failed
+ exit 1


Edit out all references to M3Config and might as well also Version
in m3-sys/cm3/src/Main.m3.

3)
Testing older X apps on MacOS X with Apple's X, you will always get:

bash-3.2$  ./Juno

*** runtime error:
***    Exception "IPError.FatalError" not in RAISES list

because Apple sets DISPLAY=/tmp/launch-gTYtJF/:0.
I suspect you might also have trouble with tunneling over ssh, not sure.

pick up current
 m3-ui/ui/src/xvbt/XSharedMem.m3
 
Note that this isn't really properly fixed, in current source.
Just kinda sorta mostly.
 
But wait, no. Current source doesn't work with older m3core.
Arg.
 
Change SameHost in that file to just return TRUE or FALSE.
FALSE is probably always safe, even if it is wrong.
