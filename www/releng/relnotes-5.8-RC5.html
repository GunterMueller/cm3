    <h1>Release Notes CM3 5.8.5</h1>

    <p>
      Hopes often cheat, so we're now at the fifth release candiate.
      The <a href="http://hudson.modula3.com:8080/view/makedist/job/cm3-makedist-AMD64_LINUX/14/changes">detailed list of changes</a>
      can be seen at one of the Hudson release build jobs.
    </p>

    <h1>Release Notes CM3 5.8.4</h1>

    <p>
      The fourth release candidate will hopefully be the last one
      before the final release. Some problems relating to threading
      have been fixed as well as some bugs in the Windows runtime.

      of the CM3 trac service.
    </p>

    <h1>Release Notes CM3 5.8.3</h1>

    <p>
      The second release candidate still had several problems most
      of which should be corrected now in RC3.
    </p>

    <h1>Release Notes CM3 5.8.2</h1>

    <p>
      There have been a lot of changes and improvements since the last
      release of CM3, 5.4.0, in the fall of 2006. Of course there have
      been lots of development snapshots and contributed installation
      archives for various target platforms since then, but, alas, no
      official release. So we're finally there. In case you wonder why
      this is release candidate 2 (RC2), that's because the first was
      only used internally and not announced here.

      <a href="http://www.opencm3.net/ChangeLog-2009">2009</a>
      for a complete list of changes. Here's a summary of the
      highlights:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Updated support for various Windows platforms (native,
        Cygwin, Mingwin, Interix). It is possible to use many Microsoft
        SDKs (including free ones) as the basis for native support now.</li>
      <li>Many improvements to m3gdb, the Modula-3-aware extension of
        the GNU debugger. It's still not perfect, but then, what is?</li>
      <li>System pthread threading is now the default on all
        platforms.  On
        many systems, this allows M3 applications to scale over all
        available hardware processors.The original (fast) M3 user
        level thread code is still there and can be used if necessary
        (on most platforms).
      </li> 
      <li>Many fixes and improvements of the garbage collector.</li>
      <li>Many fixes and improvements of the system pthreads
      implementation.</li>
      <li> There is a new type LONGINT. It is a 64bit signed integer
      on all platforms except the native NT "NT386" platform. On NT386
      it is 32bits. This is fixed in "head", for the next release, 5.9.</li>
      <li>Much improved and restructured CM3 config files.</li>
      <li>Added lots of new quake functions and fixed several quake
      bugs.</li>
      <li>Import of gcc 4.3.0 as code generating backend.</li>
      <li>Support for new 64 bit target platforms
      (AMD64_LINUX, AMD64_DARWIN, AMD64_FREEBSD, and others).</li>
      <li>Added CM3-IDE, the open source version of Reactor (tm). This
      is a browser-based IDE for Modula-3 developement.</li>
      <li>Extensive refactoring of platform specific interfaces and
      reduction of system dependencies.</li>
      <li>Updated and extended quake documentation. Improved
      miscellaneous other documentation. Updated all generated source
      documentation for all packages.</li>
      <li>Addition of manual pages for cm3, quake, m3makefiles.</li>
      <li>Several fixes for <em>pickling</em> code (object
      (de)serialization).</li>
      <li>Improved allocation code for concurrent use cases.</li>
      <li>Add alternative text implementation which promises much
      better performance -- not activated yet, but available for
      testing.</li>
      <li>Improved dynamic linking support using rpath and $ORIGIN.</li>
      <li>Added CVSup to the CM3 repository.</li>
      <li>Compiler support for the minimal tagged REFANY values.</li>
      <li>Make optimization at level 3 work for the gcc backend.</li>
      <li>Support for many additional targets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An extensive regression test framework based on 
      <a href="http://tinderbox.elegosoft.com/tinderbox/cm3/status.html">
        Tinderbox</a> and (recently)
      <a href="http://hudson.modula3.com:8080/">Hudson</a> and
      lots of existing tests has been added, which should help to
      avoid decrease in quality.
