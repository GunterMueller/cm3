<p>
The m3lua package contains language bindings to the lua library
liblua-5.1.  This consists of both a low level "raw" interface
closly matching the "C" API, and a higher level API created in
Modula-3 to provide an object oriented interface.
</p>
<p>
Also provided in the "check" directory is a simple example 
written in Modula-3 using the "raw" interface.
</p>
<p>
This should only be built if the build system has the lua
development ("C" headers) files installed.
