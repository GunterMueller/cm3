OrdSets is a generic interface and module for sets of large-range
ordinal types, in functional style.  See comments in OrdSets.ig for
details on the package and its use.

This directory is set up to run a large number of randomly-generated
test cases on an INTEGER instantiation, with side-by-side running and
result comparison with an older, naive but much simpler and
differently coded module (Sets) with similar purpose.  Compile and run
the resulting executable with "test -a" for the most general test, or
"test -h", for help with more options.

To use in another program, you will need to put copies of OrdSets.ig
and Ordsets.mg in a source directory and instantiate them using your
m3makefile.  You can use IntForOrdSets.i3 as instantiatiating
interface to OrdSets.ig to instantiate for INTEGER.  You can use
IntSets.[im]3 as instantiations.  Alternatively you can copy the
build_generic_intf and build_generic_impl commands in the m3makefile
to accomplish the instantiations using the Modula-3 build system.
Both instantiation methods are exemplified in the m3makefile, the
former commented out.

You can use WidecharForOrdSets.i3 and WidecharSets.[im]3 in the same
ways to instantiate with WIDECHAR.  A WIDECHAR instantation is made
and imported into Test, just to test for clean compile on another
instantiation.  Its execution is not tested.

BitNoTable.i3 and UnsafeUtils.[im]3 are needed by any instantiation.
BitNoTable.i3 is mechanically generated by the program GenBitNoArrays,
found in directory bitnos, beside this directory ordsets.  You can use
it to regenerate BitNoTable.i3.

Sets.[im]3 and Test.m3 are only used in the test main program compiled
by this directory and should not be needed in another program.
