Generic Data Type:
   A BitVector.T is an unbounded vector of Boolean values. There
   is no limit to the size of a bit vector, but the default
   implementation does not represent sparse vectors any more
   efficiently than dense ones. Bit vectors are useful for
   representing sets of small, non-negative integers.
