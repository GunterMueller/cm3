(* Threading stress-test.

   Create a number of threads.  n is specified via nPer, It is
   reasonable for nPer to be from 1 to a few hundred.  nPer defaults
   to 3 but can be set by the -n command-line switch.

   Other command-line switches:

   -wait <steps>
      how many one-second waits to execute between prints (default 10)

   -iters <iters>
      how many iterations to run for (default 10)

   -tests <test1>,<test2>,...
      comma-separated list of tests (default std types)
      can specify all with "ALL" or standard tests with "STD"
      and can subtract tests with -<name of test>
      examples.
         -tests read,alloc,creat

         -tests ALL,-read

   The threads created are of five types.  Each type of thread starts
   by sleeping for a while, to give the other threads a chance to be
   created.

   The threads are of the following types:

   1. Reader -- continuously read the contents of the file "hohum",
      created during startup in CWD by the main thread.

   2. Forker -- repeatedly fork a subprocess that sleeps for one second
      using Process.Create.

   2b. ForkTooMuch -- fork "sleep 10" and do NOT call Process.Wait.
      May generate lots of zombies.

   3. Allocator -- repeatedly allocate heap memory and perform
      meaningless operations on it.

   4. Creator -- repeatedly fork a simple Thread.T that does nothing
      and exits.  Wait for it to exit before forking another.

   5. Locker -- repeatedly increment or decrement a single integer
      variable from within a MUTEX-protected critical section.

   6. ReaderNoExcept -- like Reader but without TRY-EXCEPT

   7. TryExcept -- a loop that catches an exception that never happens

   Each thread writes the the it performs an operation to the times1
   array.  The times1 array is copied by the main thread, every 10+
   seconds, into the times2 array.  No locks are used to synchronize
   this copying activity as we don't want to introduce too many possible
   places things could deadlock.

   The main thread then prints out how long ago the thread that has not
   written times1 last wrote that array.

   Note that actions in the main thread may allocate memory and therefore
   acquires locks in ThreadPThread.m3, the file which the program is
   mainly intended to test.  The design is based on a knowledge of the
   internal behavior of ThreadPThread.m3 and also on a knowledge of the
   misbehavior of existing, highly multithreaded applications.


   FAIRNESS ISSUES

   Especially with user threads, there may be fairness problems.  The
   point of the program is to test threading so there is obviously no
   attempt at enforcing fairness.  With user threads, this may cause
   certain types of threads to monopolize the cpu.  "STD,-lock" might
   be advised for the list of tests for user threads.

 (* March 14, 2011, R.C.Coleburn:
       Added -verbose option and thread loop iteration counting with explicit notification of starved/deadlocked threads.
       Added pp.finish() to tell if all command line parameters were processed.
