<HR>

The pickle package included in the SRC distribution does not work entirely
as expected.  The problems include
<UL>
<LI> No conversion between different endians, word sizes or floating point 
formats is done.  Thus, pickles can only be read on machines that are virtually
the same as the ones on which they were written.
<LI> The pickler would occasionally crash on complex objects.
</UL>

<p>

The problems are fairly serious.  Most importantly, network objects cannot
be used between machines with different architectures since the pickler is
used to transfer objects used as arguments to, or results from, method calls.

<p>
This package corrects most of the problems.  The only area of work still to
be done is floating point format conversion, but since all the machines I
have access to use IEEE format floats, I cannot test such conversion routines
(nor do I have any motivation to write them).

<p>
I also added another public interface, <i>PickleStubs.i3</i>, which allows
many common data types to be easily read and written in custom pickles.

<p>

To use this, replace the <i>libm3/src/pickle</i> subdirectory in the 
source distribution with these files and recompile.  

<p>
Note that to actually use this, a bug needs to be fixed in the <i>RTTipe.m3</i>
file in the m3core package.  This bug fix is included in the next release
(after 3.5.3) of SRC M3, but you can get it from me if you need it.

<p>
Also, to actually make successful network object calls between machines of
different word sizes, a small change must be made to <i>StubLib.m3</i> in
the netobj package.  The same applies as above:  the fix should be in
the next release, but you can also get it from me.
