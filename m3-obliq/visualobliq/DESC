visobliq - Visual Obliq: programming environment for distributed applications
</p>
<p>
Visual Obliq is a programming environment for
multi-user applications, expressed in the Obliq language.
</p>
<p>
In the Visual Obliq model, a distributed session is started by loading
an application into an Obliq interpreter. This creates a session with
a certain unique public name. Users running interpreters at other
sites can connect to the session via the session-name. The act of
joining a session causes the appropriate client code and user
interface specification to migrate to the client's address-space and
run there.  
</p>
<p>
All the above activities can be supported and
coordinated within the World-Wide Web framework. A Visual Obliq
program may be regarded as a document with an appropriate MIME
type. The text of an application is disseminated as a
MIME-encapsulated document by a Visual Obliq gateway (vocgi).
