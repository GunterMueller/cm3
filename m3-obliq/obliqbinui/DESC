Obliq-binui - a lightweight language for network objects
</p>
<p>
Obliq linked with user interface libraries. See "obliq".
</p>
<p>
An  interactive  interpreter for the Obliq language.  Obliq is a small,
statically scoped, untyped language.  It  is  object-oriented,  higher-
order,  and distributed. State is local to an address space, while com-
putation can migrate over  the  network.  The  distributed  computation
mechanism is based on Modula-3 Network Objects.

Obliq  requires  copies  of  netobjd  to  be running on all appropriate
machines, if network objects are to be used.
