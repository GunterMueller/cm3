A <b>stable object</b> is an object whose state is stored on the disk
    or other medium whence its state can be recovered if a program crashes.
</p>
<p>
    The generic interface "Stable" defines a subtype of a given object
    type that is just like that object type, but stable.  The generic
    argument to "Stable" is an interface named "Data", which is
    assumed to contain an object type named "Data.T".  Thus the type
    "Stable(Data).T" is like a "Data.T", but stable.  In case of a
    failure (of either the program or the system) such objects can
    recover by resuming their last recorded state.
</p>
<p>
    The state of a stable object is stored as a checkpoint together 
    with a redo log; the log contains entries for all updates performed 
    since the last checkpoint. These updates are recorded by logging 
    a number identifying an update method, together with the arguments 
    of the method. The typical cost for an update is therefore on 
    the order of the cost of a single disk write.
