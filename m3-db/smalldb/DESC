This package will maintain a copy of a data structure on secondary storage,
   and will update the secondary storage as updates are made to the data
   structure. A client can use this package to ensure that the current value
   of the data structure can be recovered after any crash. This package is
   efficient: the cost of recording an update is about one disk write.
