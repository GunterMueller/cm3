% October 18, 2006 in Windows cmd
% ported to Quake December 31, 2006 so it might be run at the right time in a build (ie: the first package, before m3core)
% Possibly also for a hypothetical Windows targeted non-Windows hosted build.
% 
% This is the second stage in producing Windows import .libs.
% Given Quake code snippets output by make-lib-1.cmd, produce
% .c and .def files and compile and link them. The .c files just
% contain empty functions with the right names and the signatures --
% signatures just being the right number of bytes of parameters, the
% right types are not needed.
%

%
%
% The .libs that come with CM3 5.2.6 do not work with Visual C++ prior to 5.0, nor with 8.0.
% The Visual C++ 7.1 and 8.0 Express Editions are missing many .libs.
% We are stuck with no /really simple/ solution, but several not too difficult solutions.
%
% We could detect the linker version and accept the 5.2.6 .libs.
%   We presently do no toolset version checking, though this isn't a bad option.
%   Toolset version checking in Quake, cmd, and nmake has been shown to be easy enough.
%
% We could delete the .libs if using Visual C++ 2.0 or 4.0.
%    Again, we don't do toolset version checking.
%
% We could delete the .libs unconditionally and users of Express Editions must
% install the free download Platform SDK.
%    This is not a bad option.
%
% We could detect the linker version and have like \cm3\lib\vc20, \cm3\lib\vc40, \cm3\lib\vc50, etc.
% Some of these directories would be copies of \cm3\lib, others would be generated by make-lib-2.
%
% We could require users (esp. of older toolsets) to run scripts\win\lib\make-lib-2.
%   This is ok. This is almost what we do.
%
% We could run make-lib-2 for folks automatically.
%   That is what we do. This is good.
%
% Future binary distributions should perhaps contain .libs built with the oldest supported toolset (perhaps
%  that is already the case). But this automatic way should be good.
%
%

%
% The kernel32.lib installed by CM3 5.2.6 is missing InterlockedCompareExchange
% that is needed by msvcrt.lib 8.0.
%
% The user32.lib installed by 5.2.6 causes the Visual C++ 4.0 linker to
% have an "internal error".
%
% The wsock32.lib installed by 5.2.6 causes the Visual C++ 4.0 linker to
% error regarding corrupt debugging information.
%
% There are more link errors, make everything.
%

%
% It would be nice if we could turn off linking to all .libs, but we cannot. This does nothing.
% This is only part of the commented out attempt to use Quake more and exec("cl...") less.
% It does nothing either way.
