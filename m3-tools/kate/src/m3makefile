% Here are syntax highlighting patterns for Kate and other KDE editors.
% They allow for a nice look in konqueror, etc.

% If a syntax highlighting description is found for the first time
% some information is copied to
% .kde/share/config/katesyntaxhighlightingrc
% It is not updated later though.

% You are adviced to copy or link the files to
%    /opt/kde3/share/apps/katepart/syntax
