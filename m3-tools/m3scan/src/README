This is a different implementation of the M3 scanner, which is more
modular than that contained in m3-sys/m3scanner. Several modules will
conflict with those of m3-sys/m3scanner, so that both can not be used
at once. This package has been imported from the PM3 distribution for
quick porting of other PM3 packages.
