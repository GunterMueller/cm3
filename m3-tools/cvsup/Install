                          Installing CVSup
			  ----------------

Installing from the Source Distribution
---------------------------------------
You will need:

    * The Modula-3 system.  I strongly recommend that you use the
      "ezm3" distribution.  The distribution files and simple
      installation instructions can be found at:
	  
	  http://www.polstra.com/projects/freeware/ezm3/

    * The "zlib" compression library.  Version 1.0.4 or later is
      required.  This is a standard part of FreeBSD systems.
      The sources are available from:

	  http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

See the "Announce" file for some additional hints for various
platforms.

FreeBSD ports and packages are available for both Modula-3 and CVSup.
These will be found in the subdirectories "lang" and "net", respectively.

After installing these prerequisites, simply chdir into the top-level
directory of the CVSup source distribution, and type "make".  That will
build the client and server.  To install them both, type "make install".

By default, the client and server are linked dynamically.  If you
build like this, you'll get fully static executables:

    make M3FLAGS=-DSTATIC

You can also build the client without GUI support by adding "-DNOGUI"
to the "M3FLAGS" variable:

    make M3FLAGS="-DSTATIC -DNOGUI"
