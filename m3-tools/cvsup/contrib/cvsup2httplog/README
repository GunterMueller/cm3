The cvsup2httplog perl script converts a cvsupd log file to standard
httpd log file format, so that it can be analyzed by tools such as
webalizer.  The documentation is in the script itself.  Run:

  pod2text cvsup2httplog

to get the manual.

Note, cvsup2httplog currently works only with log files written
directly by cvsupd, using "-l logfile" on the cvsupd command line.
Log files from syslog are not yet handled properly, due to the
different format they use to represent dates.
