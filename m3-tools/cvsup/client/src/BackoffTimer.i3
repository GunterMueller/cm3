INTERFACE BackoffTimer;

IMPORT Thread, Time;

TYPE
  T <: ROOT;

(* A "BackoffTimer.T", or backoff timer, supports timed retries through
   exponential backoff with random jitter. *)

PROCEDURE New(min, max: Time.T;
              backoff: REAL;
	      jitter: REAL): T;
(* Creates a new backoff timer with the given parameters. *)

(* Disregarding "jitter" for a moment, the first retry interval will be
   "min".  Subsequent retry intervals will increase by the factor
   "backoff" each time, until "max" is reached.

   "jitter" is applied after the above calculation.  It specifies the
   magnitude of the random component relative to the number calculated
   above.  For example, a "jitter" of 0.1 will cause the interval to be
   perturbed randomly each time by plus or minus 10 percent. *)

PROCEDURE Pause(bt: T);
(* Pause until it is time for the next retry. *)

PROCEDURE AlertPause(bt: T) RAISES {Thread.Alerted};
(* Like "Pause", but alertable. *)

PROCEDURE Get(bt: T): Time.T;
(* Returns the retry interval that will be used the next time "Pause" or
   "AlertPause" is called. *)

END BackoffTimer.
