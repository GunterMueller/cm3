This is a modified version of the "tcp" package that comes with the DEC
SRC Modula-3 distribution.  I had to fix several crippling bugs, as well
as add some much-needed functionality.  I am going to try to get these
enhancements folded back into the official SRC release.  Then, we could
go back to using the standard package.

Most of the sources in this tree are modified copies of the DEC sources.
Those that are fall under the very reasonable DEC license terms.  See
the "COPYRIGHT" file for details.
