     The ccvvppaasssswwdd utility creates scrambled passwords for the CCVVSSuupp server's
     authentication database.  It is invoked with a client name and a server
     name.  _C_l_i_e_n_t_N_a_m_e is the name the client uses to gain access to the
     server.  By convention, e-mail addresses are used for all client names,
     e.g., `BillyJoe@FreeBSD.ORG'.  Client names are case-insensitive.

     _S_e_r_v_e_r_N_a_m_e is the name of the CCVVSSuupp server which the client wishes to
     access.  By convention, it is the canonical fully-qualified domain name
     of the server, e.g., `CVSup.FreeBSD.ORG'.  This must agree with the
     server's own idea of its name.  The name is case-insensitive.

     To set up authentication for a given server, one must perform the follow-
     ing steps:

     1.   Obtain the official _s_e_r_v_e_r_N_a_m_e from the administrator of the server
          or from some other source.

     2.   Choose an appropriate _c_l_i_e_n_t_N_a_m_e.  It should be in the form of a
          valid e-mail address, to make it easy for the server administrator
          to contact the user if necessary.

     3.   Choose an arbitrary secret _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d.

     4.   Run ccvvppaasssswwdd, and type in the _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d when prompted for it.  The
          utility will print out a line to send to the server administrator,
          and instruct you how to modify your $HOME_/_._c_v_s_u_p_/_a_u_t_h file.  You
          should use a secure channel to send the line to the server adminis-
          trator.

     Since $HOME_/_._c_v_s_u_p_/_a_u_t_h contains passwords, you should ensure that it is
     not readable by anyone except yourself.
