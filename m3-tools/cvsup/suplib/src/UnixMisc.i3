TYPE
  SignalHandler = PROCEDURE (sig: Ctypes.int);

PROCEDURE AppendAlways(file: File.T)
  RAISES {OSError.E};
(* Mark the underlying file descriptor so that writes always append to
   the end of the file. *)

PROCEDURE FStat(file: File.T;
                VAR statbuf: Ustat.struct_stat)
  RAISES {OSError.E};
(* Gets the status of the given file. *)

PROCEDURE GetHostAddrs(host: TEXT): REF ARRAY OF IP.Address;
(* Returns an array containing all of a host's IP addresses.  Returns
   NIL if the name lookup fails.  Not re-entrant. *)

PROCEDURE GetHostName(): TEXT
  RAISES {OSError.E};
(* Returns the host name as obtained from "Unix.gethostname()". *)

PROCEDURE GetLogin(): TEXT;
(* Returns the user's login name, or "NIL" if it is not known. *)

PROCEDURE GetMode(path: Pathname.T): Utypes.mode_t
  RAISES {OSError.E};
(* Returns the file mode for the given file. *)

PROCEDURE GetUmask(): Utypes.mode_t;
(* Returns the umask setting. *)

PROCEDURE MapFile(p: Pathname.T;
                  VAR statbuf: Ustat.struct_stat): ADDRESS
  RAISES {OSError.E};
(* Maps the given file into memory with a read-only shared mapping.
   Fills in "statbuf" with the status information of the file.
   Returns the address of the mapped region.  It is a checked runtime
   error to attempt to map anything but a regular file. *)

PROCEDURE MaskMode(mode: Utypes.mode_t; umask := -1): Utypes.mode_t;
(* Returns the given mode, as modified by the "umask" value.  If it
   is defaulted, then the program's umask setting is used. *)

PROCEDURE ReadLink(path: Pathname.T): TEXT
  RAISES {OSError.E};
(* Reads the given symbolic link and returns it as text. *)

<* EXTERNAL "setsid" *>
PROCEDURE SetSID(): Utypes.pid_t;
(* Set session-ID. *)

<* EXTERNAL "UnixMiscSigIsIgnored" *>
PROCEDURE SigIsIgnored(sig: Ctypes.int): BOOLEAN;

<* EXTERNAL "UnixMiscSignal" *>
PROCEDURE Signal(sig: Ctypes.int;
                 func: SignalHandler): SignalHandler;
(* Like the standard C signal() function, except it disables thread
   scheduling when the handler is executing. *)
