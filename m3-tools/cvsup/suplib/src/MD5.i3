(* An "MD5.T" calculates the MD5 checksum of some data.  After it is
   initialized by the "init" method, it may be supplied with data
   in arbitrary chunks, via calls to "update" and/or "updateText".
   After all data has been processed, either "finish" or "finishRaw"
   should be called to retrieve the checksum and free all the
   resources associated with the "MD5.T".  The former returns the
   checksum in text form, as a 32-character string.  The latter
   returns the checksum in raw (binary) form.

   The "clone" method returns a new "MD5.T" with an exact copy of the
   state of the existing one. *)

PROCEDURE New(): T;
(* Creates and initializes a checksum generator, and returns it. *)

PROCEDURE NewRCS(): T;
(* Creates and initializes a special checksum generator for RCS files.
   It canonicalizes the checksum in such a way as to disregard
   irrelevant differences in white space. *)

PROCEDURE FileSignature(name: Pathname.T): TEXT
  RAISES {OSError.E};
(* Return the MD5 signature, in text form, of an entire file.  WARNING: The
   MD5 library allocates a buffer of BUFSIZ bytes (from <stdio.h>) on the
   stack, to perform this function.  Take care that the calling thread's
   stack has enough space to allow this. *)

END MD5.
