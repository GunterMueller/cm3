(* The "MD5Wr" interface provides a subclass of "Wr.T" which computes
   the MD5 signature of everything it writes. *)

INTERFACE MD5Wr;

IMPORT MD5, Wr;

TYPE
  T <: Public;

  Public = Wr.T OBJECT METHODS
    init(wr: Wr.T;
	 md5: MD5.T := NIL;
	 closeChild: BOOLEAN := TRUE): T;
    getSignature(): TEXT;
  END;

(* If "closeChild" is "TRUE" (the default), then closing the escaped
   writer will also cause the child writer to be closed.  If it is "FALSE",
   then the child writer will be left open.

   By default, the signature is computed over exactly the bytes
   that have been written to the MD5 writer.  If the "md5" parameter
   is specified, then it can be used to accumulate bytes onto an
   existing partially calculated signature.

   The "getSignature" method may only be called after the "MD5Wr.T" has
   been closed.  It returns the text form of the signature. *)

END MD5Wr.
