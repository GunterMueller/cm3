(* This module works as follows.  A Unix pipe is created, but unlike
   typical pipes, it is used entirely within a single process.  When
   a signal comes in, a single byte containing the signal number is
   written to the pipe.  This is a safe thing to do from a signal
   handler on POSIX systems, and it doesn't involve the garbage
   collector or thread scheduler in any way.  All Unix systems that I
   know of allow many bytes to be written before the write call will
   block.

   A background thread executes a loop, reading bytes from the pipe
   and dispatching control to the Handlers selected by the signal
   numbers they contain.  The Handlers execute as normal Modula-3
   thread code.  Thus they can do anything. *)
