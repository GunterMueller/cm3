Support tool for Modula-3 network objects.
Stubgen is a program that generates stubs for Modula-3 network
objects.  Network objects are Modula-3 objects whose methods may
be invoked from multiple address spaces.  They thus provide an
object-based form of remote procedure call.  For a description of
network objects and examples of their use, see the network objects
paper available from "printdoc netobj".
