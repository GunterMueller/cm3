/*
This is a wrapper for \cygwin\bin\cvs.exe that doesn't require changing %PATH%.
Put it in some directory already in %PATH%, such as %WinDir% or %WinDir%\system32.
As well, on the Elego Windows VM, \Program Files\CVSNT has been renamed to CVSNT.1
to get it out of %PATH%. It ruins line endings.
As well \SFU was mostly renamed to \SFU.1, to remove it as a possible factor, though
it turns out it was probably completely innocent.
As well, CVS_RSH changed to /bin/ssh. Plain "ssh" as all other Hudson jobs use would
probably work if in this wrapper we prepended c:\cygwin\bin to %PATH%.

Build it with:
    cl -Zl cvs.c -link -entry:Entry -subsystem:console kernel32.lib
