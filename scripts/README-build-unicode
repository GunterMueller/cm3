Bootstrapping CM3 with full-range Unicode support.

The CM3 build system can be bootstrapped by the 5.8 release compiler or
head compilers since.  With a working 'cm3' command, here is the procedure: 

1. In your local cm3 distribution directory, 
   'cvs update -d'
   This will get the latest source files.

2. In the cm3/scripts directory, 
   './find-packages.sh'
   This will locate new package libunicode.  

3. In the cm3/scripts directory, 
   './upgrade.sh'
   This will build the latest compiler and its support, configured, by 
   default for 16-bit WIDECHAR. 

4. Edit file /usr/local/cm3/bin/cm3.cfg to add the line:
   Unicode_WIDECHAR="TRUE"
   after the INSTALL_ROOT = ... line.  
   This will configure the compiler for full-range Unicode.

5. Back in scripts, './do-cm3-front.sh buildship'
   This will rebuild the compiler and its support for full-range Unicode.

6. './install-cm3-compiler upgrade'
   This will install the rebuilt compiler in the bin directory.

7. Rebuild other package groups as you need, with
   './do-cm3-<x>.sh buildship'
   for <x> IN {base, core, gui, comm, caltech-parser, all}.

libunicode will not build unless the compiler is configured for full-range 
Unicode and it and its support rebuilt that way.

A few packages entailed by do-cm3-all.sh will not build.  These problems are
unrelated to Unicode support.
