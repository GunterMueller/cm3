This directory contains scripts to automatically build/test cm3 and send
the results to a tinderbox server.


Automatic building & regression testing
---------------------------------------
For this purpose you can use defs.sh like the following:

Install your cm3 base release once:
# ( . defs.sh ; download_bin_dist )
# ( . defs.sh ; install_bin_dist )
It'll ask where to install. You MUST install to the directory given by the
script before! Scroll back and look for a line like
"manual installation required. Install into /home/kaspar/work/cm3-inst/booze/rel-5.4.0!"

Then you can checkout the newest CVS with:
# ( . defs.sh ; checkout )

To build cm3 using the last release:
# ( . defs.sh ; test_build_core_rel )

Likewise, to build cm3 using the last OK build:
# ( . defs.sh ; test_build_core_lastok )


tinderbox-build.sh
------------------
In order to do fully automatic testing, you can use the script tinderbox-build.sh.
It takes a build configuration file as it's only argument.
Please use cm3.build, it's what we at elego are using to run the
checkout/build/test cycle.

Let's assume you are in the directory "cm3/scripts/regression" or it's
contents are in the working directory.

For the example build configuration cm3.build to work, you need to
install a base binary distribution first (do this only once per host):

# ( . defs.sh ; download_bin_dist )
# ( . defs.sh ; install_bin_dist )

This will install into "~/work".

Now you can invoke the whole checkout, build and test cycle, using the
last release binary distribution as base, with
# ./tinderbox-build.sh cm3.build

If you want to use the last sucessfully built version as base, invoke
# BUILD_REL=lastok ./tinderbox-build.sh cm3.build

By default, this will just output the results to stdout.
If you'd like to contribute your test results to the elego tinderbox server,
contact us so we can set up an account for you. Your committer-account will do fine.
Next you need to uncomment right line of the "tinderbox_mailer"-function in cm3.build.

Now make sure you have set up passwordless ssh to modula3.elegosoft.com and tinderbox.elego.de. I needed to change my your ~/.ssh/config.

Now you can do
# ./tinderbox-build.sh cm3.build
or
# BUILD_REL=lastok ./tinderbox-build.sh cm3.build
as above. We do it nightly in a cron job.
