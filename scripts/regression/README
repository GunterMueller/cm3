This directory contains scripts to automatically build/test cm3 and send
the results to a tinderbox server.

!! This is a draft. currently, our tinderbox only accepts build results from
!! internal hosts. Stay tuned ;)

Automatic building & regression testing
---------------------------------------

For this purpose you can use defs.sh like the following:

Install your cm3 base release once:
# ( . defs.sh ; install_bin_dist )

Then you can checkout the newest CVS with:
# ( . defs.sh ; checkout )

To build cm3 using the last release:
# ( . defs.sh ; test_build_core_rel )

Likewise, to build cm3 using the last OK build:
# ( . defs.sh ; test_build_core_lastok )


Tinderbox
---------
In order to send build results to the elegosoft tinderbox host,
you can use the script tinderbox-build.sh.
It takes a bulid configuration file as only argument. Check cm3.build for an
example.

For the example cm3.build to work, you need to install a base binary
distribution:
# export INSTBASE="${HOME}/cm3-build/`hostname`/cm3-inst"
# ( . defs.sh; install_bin_dist )

Now you can invoce the whole checkout, build, test cycle, using the
last release binary distribution as base, with
# ./tinderbox-build.sh cm3.build

If you want to use the last sucessfully built version as base, invoke
# BUILD_REL=lastok ./tinderbox-build.sh cm3.build

If you'd like to contribute your own test results, take cm3.build as an
example and change the functions do_checkout. do_compile and do_tests 
according to your needs.
