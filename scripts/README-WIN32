There are some Windows CMD shell scripts that should make life for pure
Windows users considerably easier. These are:

  cm3Proj.cmd           -- build/ship/clean a set of packages

  cm3SetupCmdEnv.cmd    -- set up environment for calling cm3

  startReactor.cmd      -- setup environment and start Reactor
        NOTE: Reactor is currently _not_ available as open source.

  do-cm3-std.cmd        -- simple iterative script to build several
                           standard packages

The scripts have been contributed by Randy Coleburn. He writes:

  For each command file (i.e., script), I've created an HTML
  documentation page.  Each command file also has a 'help' feature and a
  'remarks' feature. 

  The command files need to be placed in the cm3/bin folder.  You could
  probably also place the HTML files there as well, and/or put them in
  the cm3/doc folder.  I'm not sure if everything in the v526_all.CM3P
  file is in the correct compilation order.  This file should probably
  go in the scripts folder, but it will need to be moved to the root of
  the user's source tree to be useful with cm3Proj.CMD. 

So in order to use this files you will have to do some manual
installation. Let's assume you have installed CM3 in c:\cm3 and your
workspace is located at c:\work\cm3. You should then do the following:

  CMD> c:
  CMD> cd \work\cm3\scripts
  CMD> copy cm3Proj.cmd c:\cm3\bin
  CMD> copy cm3SetupCmdEnv.cmd c:\cm3\bin
  CMD> copy startReactor.cmd c:\cm3\bin
  CMD> copy v526_all.CM3P ..

If you've set your path correctly (as the cminstall program
suggested), you should then be able to use the scripts to build cm3
packages and your own projects.

Please refer to the files

for details about the scripts' purpose and use.
