DONE
====
 (ow) implemented most of the functionality needed for software package
      managemend
 (ow) bugfix: call editor if no commit message is specified
 (ow) 15.05.1997 added error parsing for all CVS output on stderr
 (ow) ??.09.1997 implemented package checkout
 (ow) 29.09.1997 made the state functions IsRelease() and IsSticky()
                 less probable to succeed by adding more checks.
                 One major check is still missing, though.
 (ow)  4.10.1997 added `heedErrors := TRUE' parameter to CVS.LogFile()
                 and used it to work around unwanted fatal errors in
                 CVS.Tags() and CVS.TaggedRevisions()
