STATUS
======
  This package contains modules extracted from pkg_parse, that really
  didn't belong there. It is quite usable, but needs some work to make 
  it more autonomous. This cannot be done without major changes to
  pkg_parse and pkg_build, so we have to postpone it.

TODO
====
 () Remove all dependencies on pkg_config. Move the concerned functionality
    back to pkg_parse.
 () Make the basic type really abstract, i.e. hide all implementation
    details.
