   Dynamic display and highlighting of algorithm source code.
</p>
<p>
   An CodeView.T displays a visual trace of program execution.  When a
   procedure is called, a window pops up containing the source for the
   procedure, with the header highlighted.  As the procedure runs, each
   statement is highlighted as it is executed.  When a procedure exits, its
   window is deleted.
</p>
<p>
   The source code displayed is not necessarily the same as the code being
   executed.  An arbitrary file can be annotated and displayed as the
   source code.  The annotations indicate sections of the file to be used
   as the source code for a procedure, and delimit regions to be
   highlighted at a given point in the running program.
