FormsVBT is a system for building graphical user interfaces.
   FormsVBT provides a special-purpose language for describing
   user interfaces, an interface-builder that allows editing of
   such descriptions, and a runtime library for applications to
   make use of the user interfaces.

<p>
   The locking level for any procedure in this interface that may
   alter an installed "VBT" is "LL.sup = VBT.mu". (See the
   <em>Trestle Reference Manual</em> for a complete description
   of locking levels~\cite{TrestleTutorial}.) Most applications
   don't need to worry about "VBT.mu" because their event-handlers
   don't fork any threads that call FormsVBT.
