(* This procedure will have an external symbol of XXX__S.  As a really
   gross hack, we can manually edit any link library (at least on
   Solaris) and change an external reference to "select" to "XXX__X",
   which will pick up this.  Then, we can redirect the select call to
   SchedulerPosix.IOWait so it doesn't block the process! *)

PROCEDURE S (nfds: int; readfds, writefds, exceptfds: UNTRACED REF FDSet;

END XXX.
