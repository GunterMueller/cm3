  More animation support, including GraphVBTs and RectsVBTs.

   A GraphVBT.T is a VBT class for constructing displays of graphs of
   vertices, edges, and polygons.  Alternatively, you can use it to display
   certain other data structures; for example, you can just use GraphVBT as
   a way to draw and move vertices on a VBT.

   There are operations to build a graph, and operations to update it
   (e.g., by moving vertices to new positions, automatically bringing their
   edges with them).  Many such updates can be animated, with objects
   slowly sliding toward their new positions, etc.
</p>
<p>
   A RectsVBT continuously displays a collection of rectangles.
   Each rectangle is defined by a location in world coordinates,
   a color, and flag indicating whether it exists.  Only those
   rectangles that exist are displayed.
</p>
<p>
   The client specifies N, how many rectangle there will be, and
   then accesses the items using a number [0..N].  The 0th item
   is typically used for temporary drawing, or for highlighting.
   When the RectsVBT is refreshed, the items are painted from 1
   to N, and then 0.  Obviously, only items for which information
   has been defined are ever painted.
</p>
<p>
   The rectangles are always displayed with the client's world
   coordinate system mapped to the entire VBT domain, optionally
   with a margin of some number of points.
