   Zeus is a kernel for both multi-view editors and algorithm animation
   systems.  To a first approximation, it follows the spirit of BALSA, but
   implemented in a multi-threaded environment using an object-oriented,
   strongly-typed language.

   For historical reasons, it is the ZeusPanel and ZeusClass interfaces,
   not this interface, that are of primary interest to clients.  This
   interface explains what's going on behind the scenes; it is used by
   ZeusPanel (to provide a system for algorithm animation ) and systems
   doing multi-view editing (like the Modula-2+ version of formsedit).  If
   you are animating an algorithm and find yourself needing to import this
   interface, then something is probably wrong.  Let us know.
