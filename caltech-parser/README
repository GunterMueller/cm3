FEATURES
========

It includes four libraries:

  1. parserlib: generics that generate derived modules using
	programs built in ktok, klex, kyacc, and kext.
	See parserlib/html for documentation.

  2. m3tmplhack: allows generics to be instantiated using "gmodule" command.
	Templates are in cit_util/src/generics.tmpl,
	and example is in cit_util/src/m3makefile.

  3. paneman: emacs-like commands for splitting window/opening files
	example: see paneman/kemacs

  4. drawcontext: interface for drawing lines and text, and reading from EPS
	library drawcontext/dcpane combines these features with paneman.
	example: see drawcontext/kgv
