PL_BEGIN(Parser Generics for Modula-3)

The situation often arises that several different programs need to
parse the same language. Traditionally, each program would have its
own generated parser. This makes it hard for these programs to share
the parser or extensions to the parser. It also tends to allow for
minute variations in the language that may make the programs
incompatible.
<P>

In _TT(parserlib), the traditional lexer/parser abstraction is used as
a starting point. However, rather than directly importing each other,
the lexer and parser know only about a _TI which makes them
compatible. Also, there is no user code inserted into the generated
lexers and parsers. The generated lexers and parsers only check the
grammar of the input. Additional functionality is added by extending
each lexer or parser using _EXT. Each extended parser or lexer can
itself be further extended, allowing highly modular hierarchies of
parsers and lexers.
<P>

The lexers generated by _TT(parserlib) use convenient Modula-3
_TT(Rd.T)s and _TT(TEXT)s for their input, allowing language generated
on the fly to be parsed. The generated parsers can also be instructed
_LN(kyacc.html#exhaust,not) to exhaust their input.  This allows a
program to parse a language embedded in another language without
having an extra pass to match delimiters.
<P>

Finally, the generated lexers and parsers are _TT(OBJECT)s and do not
rely on global variables, so that many streams can be parsed
concurrently by a single process.

_H(package installation)

The following items are required in order to build _TT(parserlib):

<TABLE>
_TR(parserlib)
directory containing sources.
_TRE

_TR(cit_util)
contains _TT(TextReader.i3) and _TT(RTBrand.i3).
_TRE

_TR(term)
terminal I/O used only in debugging _TT(klex) itself.
_TRE

_TR(m3overrides)
This file must be in the same directory as _TT(parserlib).
It must specify locations of _TT(term) and _TT(cit_util) libraries,
and must disable shared library generation if programs are not
shipped.
_TRE
</TABLE>
<P>

The _TT(Makefile) in the _TT(parserlib) directory builds the following
constituent programs:
<P>

#define _TR3(name) <TR><TD>_LN(name.html,_TT(name))</TD><TD>
<TABLE>
_TR3(ktok)
generates token interface and implementation.
_TRE

_TR3(klex)
generates lexer interface and implementation.
_TRE

_TR3(kyacc)
generates parser interface and implementation.
_TRE

_TR3(kext)
generates interfaces and implementations that extend generated token,
lexer, and parser interfaces and implementations.
_TRE
</TABLE>
<P>

Finally, a library called _TT(parserlib) (in _TT(parserlib/parserlib))
contains the _LN(SeekRd.html,_TT(SeekRd)) interface which is imported
by generated
lexers, and the _LN(m3build.html,m3build template) which finds and runs the
built constituent programs.
