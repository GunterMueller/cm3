PL_BEGIN(SeekRd: Reading from standard input)

The reader used to initialize an _LN(ktok.html#RdLexer,_TT(RdLexer))
must be seekable, because the specification is that the reader must be
positionned exactly after the last token received. To get tokens from
standard input, use the _TT(SeekRd.Stdin()) procedure to open a new
seekable standard input stream. The Lexer calls a special procedure
which discards old input when possible.
