These tools have been committed to the cm3 repository as I got them
from Karl Papadantonakis <kp@caltech.edu>. They were built with pm3,
and are not yet fully compilable/usable under cm3. Fixes will be added
as I get around to working on the code. Once everything works, this
file will vanish.

As always, fixes and improvements are greatly appreciated. Please
send them to m3-support@elego.de.
