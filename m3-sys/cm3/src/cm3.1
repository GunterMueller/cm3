.TH CM3 1 08-May-2009 "CRITICAL MASS" "MODULA-3 PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL"
.SH  NAME
cm3\- Critical Mass Modula-3 Compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cm3
.RI [ options ]

./ ============ Description =========
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Critical Mass Modula-3 Compiler 
.B cm3
is a descendant of the Modula-3 compiler developed by 
Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) Systems Research Center (SRC)
and Olivetti Corp.  
.B Cm3
was a component of a commercial product (Reactor) of Critcal Mass.
When that company went out of business, Elego Software Solutions
acquired the rights to Reactor and its components.  
They released the Modula-3 compiler 
.B cm3
as an open source project, and currently support it by hosting
its web site.

.SS Expected Directory Structure
Each modula-3 software package has a root directory in which
certain files and directories may appear.  
The optional files
.IR m3makefile ", and " m3overrides 
may be placed in the root of the package directory.
All the source code should be in a directory named 
.IR src ,
and the compiler will place all generated object files, 
libraries, and exectuables in directories appropriate for the target
architecture, generating those directories in the 
package root directory if required.  
The 
.I src
directory may contain nested subdirectories further
organizing the source code.

./ ============ EXIT STATUS =========
.SH EXIT STATUS

./ ============ ENVIRONMENT STATUS =========
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B CM3_INSTALL_PREFIX
is the path prefix prepended to files being installed.  
This is similar to the behavior "make DESTDIR=${prefix}".
Use this when creating a software distribution package.
.TP
.B M3CONFIG
Platform dependent configuration file to use.  
By default this is
.IR cm3.cfg .
.TP
.B QUAKE_SHELL
Shell to be used by the quake interpreter for 
.BR exec (2).
.TP
.B QUAKE_SHELL_OPTION
Command option for the quake shell (eg., -c, or /c).
.TP
.B QUAKE_TMPDIR
The directory for temporary files used by quake.


./ ============ ENVIRONMENT STATUS =========
.SH FILES
The
.BI m3makefile (7). 
is a text file read by
.BR cm3 .
It describes any special actions needed to build or ship the
software package.  This can include linking against specified
libraries, creating documentation, or a number of other actions.

The 
.BI m3overrides (7)
file is used to stop a package from linking against the normal
cm3 system libraries, but rather use the libraries listed in this file.

./ ============ VERSIONS =========
.SH VERSIONS
The version of 
.B cm3
herein described is 5.7.1

./ ============ CONFORMING TO =========
.SH CONFORMING TO
.B cm3
conforms to DEC-SRC Research Report 52, with several additional features.
.SS Deviations
.TP
.B TEXT
The text object in which constant strings are stored, may contain 
.B unicode
characters, if no unicode characters are used, then only ASCII ones
will be used.
.TP
.B WIDECHAR
In support of unicode characters this new builtin type is a 16-bit
character, and may be used by TEXT.

.TP
.B LONGINT
The LONGINT type is an additional builtin type, and is a signed
integral type with 64 bits.
