This subdirectory has a dummy version of Modula-3 module LLGen.  
Fully implemented, LLGen would provide an instance of M3CG.T
that links in parts of the llvm infrastructure and uses them
to emit some level of translation of cm3's intermediate code,
possibly as little as just emitting llvm IR.  

This dummy version has only noop procedures.  It it here so cm3
can be built without requiring compiled llvm code, which is very
large and very slow compiling.
