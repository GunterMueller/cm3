<p>
CM3-IDE was originally developed as <a href="http://www.igencorp.com/cmass/reactor/">Reactor</a> by Bill Kalsow and Farshad Nayeri at <a href="http://www.igencorp.com/cmass/">Critical Mass, Inc.</a>, now named <a href="http://www.igencorp.com/">IGEN Corporation</a>. The software was later open-sourced through the tireless efforts of Randy Coleburn and Olaf Wagner.
