<P>
CM3-IDE maintains individualized <A HREF="/form/configure">configuration
information</A> for each user.
The information is kept in <TT>$HOME/.CM3_IDE/rstate0.txt</TT>
and <TT>$HOME/.CM3_IDE/rstate0.txt</TT>.  These files are simple
ASCII files that contain Modula-3 strings and a version number.
Each pair of strings defines a key-value pair.  The keys name
various configuration parameters and the values define their
settings.

<P>
CM3-IDE will not be able to retain your configuration information
from session to session unless the <TT>$HOME</TT> environment
variable is set and CM3-IDE can find or create a writable
directory named <TT>$HOME/.CM3_IDE</TT>.

<P>
The values that can be configured are described below.

<H3><A NAME="display">Display settings</A></H3>

<P>
<B>Home page</B> is the full pathname of a file containing the HTML page that
CM3-IDE should display initially.  The directory containing this page
will be mapped into CM3-IDE's URL namespace as <TT>&sl;user</TT>.  If
no page is specified, CM3-IDE will use its own.

<P>
The rest of the settings in this section control how CM3-IDE displays
lists of items.
If you're using a small font or large screen, you may want to
adjust these values to better suit your preferences.

<P>
If CM3-IDE needs to display a list of nodes containing
more than <B>Max display items</B>, it will try to shorten
the list by coalescing entries with common prefixes and suffixes.
<B>Max display width (chars)</B> defines the maximum number of
characters that CM3-IDE will put into a single multi-node display line.
<B>Max display width (columns)</B> defines the maximum number of
columns that CM3-IDE will put into a single multi-node display line.

<P>
If <B>Multiple windows</B> is on, CM3-IDE will use Netscape-like
window targeting to direct its various outputs to separate windows.

<H3><A NAME="package-roots">Package roots</A></H3>

<P>
CM3-IDE supports browsing and building packages from multiple &quot;package roots&quot;.
A package root is simply a directory containing one or more packages.
A package is a directory containing Modula-3 sources in a &quot;src&quot;
subdirectory and zero or more subdirectories (e.g. NT386, SOLsun, HPPA)
containing object files, libraries, and programs produced by
CM3-IDE for a particular platform.  You can specify the list of roots
that CM3-IDE is to use here.  Each root needs a short name
that will be used by CM3-IDE to form URLs, a full path in the
file system where CM3-IDE is running, and a boolean specifying whether
the user is allowed to build packages in that repository.

<P>
The &quot;example&quot; and &quot;system&quot; repositories are provided initially by CM3-IDE.

<P>
If any of the short names
you specify collide with existing roots in CM3-IDE's URL namespace,
CM3-IDE will substitute something less useful, like &quot;Root001&quot;.

<H3><A NAME="communication">Communication</A></H3>

<P>
When CM3-IDE initializes it will determine the local IP address
and name of the machine it's running on.  If networking is not
installed properly or you may need to override the default configuration.

<P>
<B>Host name</B> defines the name of the machine running CM3-IDE.
The URLs generated by CM3-IDE will contain this name and the browsers 
attached to CM3-IDE will need the name.  The default host name is
<TT>localhost</TT>.  This value should work on most platforms with
TCP installed, even those that only have intermittent SLIP or
PPP connections.  If no value is specified for the host name,
CM3-IDE attempts a reverse name server lookup using the host's IP
address.

<P>
<B>IP address</B> defines the IP address of the machine
running CM3-IDE.  You should not need to explicitly
define your IP address, unless your networking installation
is badly broken.  In case you need it, the IP address bound
to <TT>localhost</TT> is usually <TT>127.0.0.1</TT>.

<P>
<B>Server port</B> defines the TCP port number that CM3-IDE
will use.  You may need to change CM3-IDE's default value
if it conflicts with one of the TCP services already
running on your machine.  Usually, using port numbers below 1024
requires special privileges and port 8080 is often used by existing
WWW servers.

<H3><A NAME="misc">Misc</A></H3>

<P>
<B>Verbose log</B> determines how much junk CM3-IDE spits
out in its <A HREF="/log/">console log</A>.  It's best to
leave the verbose log off, unless you're
trying to track down a problem with CM3-IDE.

<P>
<B>Server threads</B> determines the number of concurrent
threads within CM3-IDE that can service HTTP requests.
If CM3-IDE becomes sluggish because there are too many
users contending for the limited server threads, it may
help to increase the number threads.  But, it's more likely
that CM3-IDE just needs to run on a machine with more memory.

<P>
<B>Refresh interval</B> is the number minutes that CM3-IDE
will wait between full rescans of your package roots.
Setting the value too small can overload your file system
and destroy performance for everyone else.

<H3><A NAME="helper-procs">Helper procedures</A></H3>

<P>
CM3-IDE uses little procedures written in Quake to interact with its
external environment.  Quake is an small interpreted language that you
should find easy to modify and the default helper procedures are quite
short.  CM3-IDE's use of these interpreted procedures maximizes your ability to
configure and control CM3-IDE's behavior.

<P>
When CM3-IDE starts it calls the <B>start_browser(u)</B> function
to initiate a WWW browser looking at the URL &quot;<TT>u</TT>&quot;.
If the function returns <TT>FALSE</TT> when
it returns, the CM3-IDE server continues running.  Otherwise,
the server terminates when the function returns.

<P>
CM3-IDE calls <B>build_package(p)</B> to build a package &quot;<TT>p</TT>&quot;.
<P>
CM3-IDE calls <B>ship_package(p)</B> to ship package &quot;<TT>p</TT>&quot;.
<P>
CM3-IDE calls <B>clean_package(p)</B> to clean package &quot;<TT>p</TT>&quot;.
<P>
CM3-IDE calls <B>run_program(p)</B> to execute program &quot;<TT>p</TT>&quot;.
<P>
And finally, CM3-IDE calls <B>edit_file(f,x)</B> to 
edit file &quot;<TT>f</TT>&quot; initially positioned at line &quot;<TT>x</TT>&quot;.
<P>
