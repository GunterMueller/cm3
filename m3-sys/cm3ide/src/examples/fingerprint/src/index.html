<H3>Quick Comparison of Large Data: Fingerprints</H3>

<p>You can use the <a href=/interface/Fingerprint>Fingerprint</a>
   interface to compare large amounts of data. 
   Fingerprints can also be used for efficient comparison of
   complex object graphs.

<p><A href=./M3Compare.m3><code>M3Compare</code></a> takes
   two file names from the command line and reports 
   whether the files are the same or different.
   The program does not crash due to exceptions.
