<h3>Calling C functions from Modula-3 (Win32)</h3>

<p> In this example, we create an interface for accessing the 
<code>MessageBox</code> function from the Win32 API. To do so,
we import the interface <a href=/interface/WinUser><code>WinUser</code></a>
which defines the signature of the 
<a href=/interface/WinUser/MessageBox/#_DECL_><code>MessageBoxA</code></a> call. 
We then call <code>WinUser.MessageBox</code> from the main module, 
<a href=./OK.m3><code>OK</code></a>.

<p>This example only works on Win32, since <code>MessageBox</code> is a 
Win32 call, however, you can do similar things on other platforms, 
hence the program is not portable. Of course, if you were to only 
use the portable interfaces available in Modula-3, you would not
have any portability problems.

<p>The good news is that most of the time, we can program in the safe
    mode, so that the language takes care of things like garbage
    collection.
