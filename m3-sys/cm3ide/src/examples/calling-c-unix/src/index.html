<title>Calling C functions from Modula-3</title>
<h3>Calling C functions from Modula-3</h3>

<p> In this example, we create an interface for accessing getcwd
function from Modula-3. We then wrap a safe interface around the
unsafe layer that calls C. (This example only works on POSIX, but a
similar example can be written for Win32 platforms. Of course, if we
were to only use Modula-3 facilities, the code could easily be
ported.)

<ol>
<li>First, read the manpage on "getcwd" to get some information about
     its parameter, and what it does.

<li>Interface Ulib contains the <*EXTERNAL*> Modula-3 signature for
    the "getcwd" function in our project. If we are to call this from client
    code, we'd have to make that unsafe, and have to deal with C data
    structures, which is probably not a good idea. So, in the next
    step, we build a safe wrapper around the C call.

<li>Create an interface and an implementation "Lib". 
            This will be the Modula-3 wrapper for
            Ulib. The idea here is to create a function,
             GetCWD() which returns a TEXT containing your
            current working directory. 

            Lib.i3 should be pretty straightforward. All you do
            is declare the signature of the function.

<li>Lib.m3 is more subtle.

	   What we need to do is allocate some space for the C
           buffer, and then pass it to "getcwd", finally copy
           the contents of the getcwd buffer back into a TEXT
           and return it. 

           We can either use Cstdlib.malloc for allocating
                   the right buffer, and Cstdlib.free to dispose it
                   after copying the buffer into a TEXT via
                   M3toC.CopyStoT. 
	
<li>Create a safe main module and call Lib.GetCWD()
                   from it.

</ol>

<p>The good news is that most of the time, we can program in the safe
    mode, so that the language takes care of things like garbage
    collection.
