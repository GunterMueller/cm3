<h2>Browsing programs</h2>

<p>To learn a bit about the browser, try finding the <tt><a href="/interface/IO">IO</a></tt>
interface. Here are some steps to help you out: </p>

<ol>
<li>Start from the <a href="/">opening screen</a>. </li>

<li>Follow link to <a href="/interface">interfaces</a>. </li>

<li>Follow link to <a href="/interface/I*">interfaces that start with &quot;I&quot;
(I...)</a> </li>

<li>Follow link to <a href="/interface/IO">IO interface</a>. </li>

<li>Once at the IO interface, notice <a href="/interface/IO/Put#_DECL_">IO.Put</a>
and <a href="/interface/IO/PutInt#_DECL_">IO.PutInt</a> procedures. What do
they do? (Answer: They write a string or an integer to the standard output.)
</li>
</ol>

<p>Browsing programs in this environment is just like browsing a web page.
You can use all the features that you know about your web browser, like
adding bookmarks for a particular interface, reloading a page when required,
or use the &quot;back&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; buttons. In fact, in
as many places as possible, we have placed hot links to let you navigate
through your program. </p>
