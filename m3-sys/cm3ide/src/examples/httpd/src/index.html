<H3>TCP/IP Server: Implementing A Simple HTTP Daemon</h3>

<p>This program, <A href=./HTTPD.m3><code>HTTPD</code></a> implements
a simple HTTP Daemon, by using the portable <a
href=/interface/TCP>TCP</a>/<a href=/interface/IP>IP</a>
interfaces. 

<p>The basic outline of the program is quite simple.  After getting a connector, loop and do the following:
<ol>
 <li>Use <code><a href=/interface/TCP/#Accept>TCP.Accept</a></code> to get a 
 new service. Each team will be assigned a port number by the instructor.
		
 <li>Get a reader and a writer to the service via <a href=/interface/ConnRW><code>ConnRW</code></a> interface.
		
 <li>The requests we are interested in start with a "GET " in the
     input reader stream. You can use the <code><a href=/interface/Lex#Match>Lex.Match</a> </code>
     for this, or role your own character by character.
		
 <li>The rest of the input from the reader until the next carriage
       return ('\n') is the path requested by the web browser.
	
 <li>Given a path requested by a <code>"GET"</code> message, look in the current directory     of your file system for the file in question.
		
     <p>So, the URL
			   
<blockquote><pre>http://host:8080/welcome.html</pre></blockquote>
		
  maps to the HTTP request to the server running on port 8080 of the machine "host" 

<blockquote><pre>GET /welcome.html</pre></blockquote>
		
which can map to
		
<blockquote><pre>./welcome.html</pre></blockquote>
		
in your file system.
	
  <li> Open the file, and read all its contents.

  <li> Write all of the contents to the writer. Flush the writer upon completion.
		
  <li> Make sure to close the reader, the writer, and the server
       connection at the bottom of the loop. 
</ol>


When you are done building the server, run it, and then click <a
