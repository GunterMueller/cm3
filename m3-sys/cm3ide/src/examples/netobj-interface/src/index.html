<H3>Network Objects: Common Interface between Client and Server</H3>

<p>
Network Objects allows a Modula-3 object to be handed to another process
in such a way that the process receiving the object can operate on it as
if it were local. The holder of a remote object can freely invoke operations
on that object just as if it had created that object locally. Further, it
can pass the object to other processes. Thus, the Network Objects system
allows the development of not just simple client-server applications, but
more general <EM>multi-tiered distributed</EM> applications.

<p>This <a href=./Bank.i3>interface</a>, and the accompanying 
<a href=/example/netobj-client>client</a> and <a href=/example/netobj-server>server</a> 
illustrate the use of Network Objects by outlining a canonical example of 
a distributed program, namely that of a remotely accessible bank.
