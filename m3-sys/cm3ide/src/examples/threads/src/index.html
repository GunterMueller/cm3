<H3>Threads: Managing Concurrent Activities</H3>

<p>The sample program, <a href=./ThreadExample.m3><code>ThreadExample.m3</code></a> illustrates 
   multi-threading programming. Using the 
   <a href=/interface/Thread>Thread</a> interface, you can create
   concurrent activities for different portions of your program. 
   Suppose, for example, you would like to update the user interface
   screens while doing a long-running query to a database. Using threads,
   you can deal with each one of these tasks separately from each other.
   The <code>Thread</code> interface also provides operations for
   communication and synchronization between threads.

<p>Standard Modula-3 libraries are thread-friendly. Some Modula-3
   libraries use threads in order to perform background activities.
