.SH Name
m3gdb \- The GNU Debugger, with Modula-3 support

.SH Description
.B m3gdb
is a modified version of
.BR gdb (1)
with support for the Modula-3 language. 

If the current language is 
.B m3 
(in the gdb sense), then all expressions
are interpreted using the Modula-3 syntax.  All values which have a
Modula-3 type are printed according to that type.
gdb does not have a concept of statement, only expressions.
Accordingly, m3gdb treats assignment statements and calls on proper 
procedures as "expressions".
In addition, 
.B m3gdb
supports two new commands.  The command
.B threads
lists the threads that exist in the program, with the first thread
being the most recently active one.  The command
.B switch 
.I n
switches the current context to the thread identified as
.IR n,
by the
.B threads
command.  If you use the
.B switch
command, you
.B must
use it again to switch back to the thread that was interrupted before
you can continue the execution of the program (i.e. the first thread
listed by the
.B threads
command).  If the 
.B switch
command is interrupted, the state of
.B m3gdb
is essentially random and most likely to cause a core dump.  The
current language must be 
.B m3
for the 
.B threads
and
.B switch
commands to work.

.SH Bugs

Many.  Please send bug reports to 
.BR rodney.bates@wichita.edu .

This release of m3gdb is based on gdb 6.4.  

Real numbers are not parsed properly.

The comparison operators (other than =), VAL, &, IN do not work.

The = operator does not work on open arrays.
