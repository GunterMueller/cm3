Package llvmbindings.

This Modula3 package contains Modula3 bindings to selected things in
llvm that are needed to interface to llvm.

A procedure binding generally requires code in three files:

1) Modula3 code in a .i3 file, that contains a (usually) zero-thickness
   Module3-to-C binding.  This is just a PROCEDURE signature in
   Modula3 syntax, using types and parameteter modes equivalent to C
   types for parameters and results.

2) C code in a .h file, that contains a prototype for a plain C
   function.  This will be #included by C++ code, but contains 'extern
   "C"' so the C++ compiler will generate unmangled link names for its
   functions.  

3) C++ code in a .cpp file, that contains a wrapper function for
   calling a C++ function inside of llvm.  This latter is usually a
   member function of a class, and also often requires type
   conversions to/from llvm's C++-but-not-C types, so the wrapper must
   be in C++.

This package supplies 1) for everything needed.  The llvm project
supplies Core.h/Core.cpp, inside its source tree, which contain 2) and
3) for a set of functions chosen by llvm's developers.  For others,
this package supplies 2) and 3) itself.    

The m3makefile will invoke make to do the C++ compilation.  It needs
variables giving the locations of llvm's include files, llvm's compiled
libraries, and other compiled libraries used by llvm.
