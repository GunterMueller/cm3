</CENTER>
<p>The purpose of this package is to introduce a new template called WindowsResource().  This template permits adding Microsoft Windows resources, such as icons, to a compiled program.  If the target platform is not Windows, no action is taken.  So, you can simply put the following lines in your program's m3makefile:<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspimport ("windowsResources")
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWindowsResource("MyProgramIconResourceFile")
<p>Or, if you don't even want to import WindowsResources when your target is not Windows, you could use the following lines instead:<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspif equal (OS_TYPE, "WIN32")
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspimport ("windowsResources")
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWindowsResource("MyProgramIconResourceFile")
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspend
