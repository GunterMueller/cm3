frames:

Derived from compiling some C examples.


Not necessarily every possibility but many.
We don't consider options that use but don't save the frame pointer.
Furthermore we probably don't consider options that don't save
the frame pointer even if they don't use it (C compiler can do that
even when asked not to, presumably only for simple cases that
it is reasonable).


no locals or parameters:
 => nothing
plus up to three bytes push esi/edi/ebx => 3 bytes


no locals, has parameters:
very small (no locals, but has parameters):
  push ebp     ; 1 byte
  mov ebp, esp ; 2 bytes
plus up to three bytes push esi/edi/ebx => 6 bytes

up to 128 frame (or 124):
 push ebp     ; 1 byte
 mov ebp, esp ; 2 bytes
 sub esp byte ; 3 bytes
 => 6 bytes

plus up to three bytes push esi/edi/ebx => 9 bytes
This is what most prologues should look like.

medium:
 push ebp     ; 1 byte
 mov ebp, esp ; 2 bytes
 sub esp dword ; 6 bytes
 => 9 bytes

plus up to three bytes push esi/edi/ebx => 12 bytes


"medium" is what Modula-3/NT386 historically always uses.
However there is a bug if frame size >= 4K.
We should try to fix it without growing the usual case.

large:

 push ebp             ; 1 byte
 mov ebp, esp         ; 2 byte
 mov eax, frame size  ; 5 bytes
 call chkstk          ; 5 bytes

13 bytes
plus up to three bytes push esi/edi/ebx => 16 bytes
