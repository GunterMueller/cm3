<H3>Accessing File Systems</H3>

<p> Using the standard <a href=/interface/FS><code>FS</code></a> and
    <a href=/interface/File><code>File</code></a> interfaces, you can
    create a portable directory listing (or "ls") command which works
    across all platforms.

<ul>
<li>If the program is passed no arguments it should list the files
   in the current directory.

<li>If the command line contains a file name it should list the
   file's name and length.
        
<li>If the command line contains a directory name, it should list
        the files in the directory.

<li>Otherwise, the program warns that the command line
        argument is unrecognized.

<li>The program handles all exceptions and does not crash.
   It will also work without change on Unix or Win32 platforms!

</ul>
