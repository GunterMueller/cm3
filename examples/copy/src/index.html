<h3>Interfaces, Modules, and Importing</h3>

<p>This "copy" program demonstrates the use of interfaces, modules, and importing.

<p>The source sources for the program are: <a href=./module/Copy><code>Copy</code></a>,
   <a href=./module/FakeOS><code>FakeOS.i3</code></a> 
   and <a href=./module/FakeOS><code>FakeOS.m3</code></a>.
   Read them to learn how to divide up your code into modules, and how to import
   existing functionality by importing interfaces.


<p>This copy program accepts the following syntax at the command line

<pre>
   % copy <em>source</em> <em>destination</em>
</pre>

<blockquote>
<font size=-1>             

<b>Note: </b>When you build this package, you will notice that a number of 
   warnings will appear. That's because this version of the copy command
   does not check for any possible runtime errors, or <em>exceptions</em>.
   To cause a run-time error, you can try copying a non-existent 
   file, and see how the program will behave. Note how the compiler helps you
   to learn about all the possible sources of exception errors at compile-time.

<p>To learn about handling of
   errors, read on to the <a href=../exceptions>exception example</a>.
